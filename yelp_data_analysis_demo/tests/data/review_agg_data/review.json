For the past year my family has been regularly visiting this sushi bar for our sushi fixes and we are never disappointed. \n\nTo begin, the atmosphere represents a touch of Japanese culture. They have many keepsakes and small pieces at the door which may or may not represent a typical Japanese shrine. In addition, similar to restaurants in Japan, they hand write specials and post them to the walls in multiple places. The specials are regularly updated despite COVID. The staff are genuinely friendly and always take the extra step to accommodate the small children we have. The miso soup for my toddler consistently comes with rice added as well as some ice to cool it down despite us never requesting this. They even bring small candies for dessert. They truly care for their guests. \n\nAs far as the food, the fish is consistently fresh and well prepared, and speaks for itself. All of the specialty rolls we have tried have been delicious including their current special the 7 star roll, which has a Sonoran flair on it. My wife will not settle for other sushi restaurants in Tucson after finding Sachiko. \n\nOne thing I wish to add is that our last visit, the salmon on our sashimi platter seemed to be a bad cut. It smelled bad and tasted bad as well. I very kindly let the staff know and requested a substitution. To our surprise they brought us 5 more pieces of fish, yellowtail and tuna, and charged us no extra. These small accommodations and gestures of good faith go a long way and mean a lot to us as guests here. We will definitely continue our loyalty to Sachiko. \n\nInsider Tip: they get their fish shipments on Tuesdays.","useful":2,"user_id":"YuLoiSGrIaROQEAK6AO34g"}

Got home only to find old, cold leftover from lunch chicken? Gross! I was so bummed, I'd been waiting on going to Hatties for 2 months but the line outside was ridiculous, so I thought I'd play it safe and indulge at home. BOOOOO! Is all I have to say. I've always enjoyed their food since the day they opened. Literally, The Day They Opened.  I've eaten at two of their other locations, but it just wasn't as good as Midtown. So, I went back to Music Row for the \"real Hatties\". Well, looks like they've outgrown their britches. What a shame!  I'm O U T. Back to Prince's, The Original Nashville Hot Chicken.

The Hot Chicken was everything I had hope and dreamed about... AND MORE!! My family and I decided to eat here, since it came highly recommended. It was probably around 8pm on a Friday evening and the line had a short hang outside of the door. We waited probably 25 minutes until we got to the counter. Not bad for a Friday night, I might add. As soon as we got to the counter, the gentleman was ready to take our order with probably the most sincere, positive greeting! I already knew (right off the bat) that it was going to be a great experience. We ordered 2 plates of hot chicken; one mild and one hot with some sides. They made a mistake on one order, but were quick to correct it and still gave us that correct order and let us keep the one that incorrectly gave us. So, we got more chicken! The crispiness was pure perfection and the spice on the mild was just enough heat for my sensitive tongue and tastebuds could handle. Just an FYI, there is no saving seats. Once you get your food, that's when you can get to your seat. Large parties can be a bit of a challenge, but totally worth the wait. Or... just order to-go! Gosh, I wish they had hot chicken in Louisiana. This takes the fried chicken game to a whole new level! I hope to be back sooner than later. The chicken was truly the highlight, but the sides were pretty decent, too... not the most memorable, but good enough for us to scarf down! If you're in Nashville looking for Hot Chicken... go directly to Hattie B's.","useful":8,"user_id":"WKIW7tWyMq7_XN0V2ouo0A"}
